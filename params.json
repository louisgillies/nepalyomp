Walking  from Devon to the Nepali Embassy in London in 5 days","body":"### Welcome to NepalYomp.\r\n\r\nThank you SO much for visiting my page.\r\n\r\nSince the Nepal Earthquake Disaster last weekend I have not been able to think-straight.The people of Kathmandu and remote mountain regions are in desperate need of our help and support.\r\n\r\nI lead treks every year in Nepal - and last year saw the Everest and Annapurna regions suffering horribly after the extreme weather and avalanches. To be hit with an earthquake of this severity is disasterous. I am receiving phonecalls and texts from my friends; the Guides and Sherpas of the Khumbu Valley - telling me that entire villages have been demolished. The monsoon season has almost arrived in the region, and all income has ceased now that the trekking season has been cut-short. It is desperate times. The isolated villages will not see assistance for quite some time. \r\n\r\nMyself and a great friend plan to walk the 170 miles from our Devon homes to the Nepali Embassy in London. We will deliver prayer flags and pay our respects for the thousands of lives that have been lost. \r\n\r\nBy joining this small campaign we hope to spread the word around UK and the world that 'everyone' can do a little bit. Â£10 in the remote corners of Nepal goes an extremely long way....through the good people of the Himalayan Trust and Shelterbox we can assist with this painful recovery. \r\n\r\nI will report back to you as to how your donation has 'made the difference' - sadly it won't be immediate, but rest assured it will transform many many lives.\r\n\r\nPlease share this link with your family and friends and follow my journey on Twitter #NepalYomp.\r\n\r\nPaul \r\n\r\n(Hi, thanks for visiting our page.
